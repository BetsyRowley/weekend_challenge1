# Carousel Application

This project was completed as a weekend assignment during my 20 weeks as a Full Stack Software Engineering student at Prime Digital Academy.

This first weekend challenge adds jQuery to build on our HTML and CSS skills to create a Carousel. The Carousel will automatically transition to the next person after 10 seconds. Alternatively, you can navigate the Carousel with the previous/next buttons.

A few weeks later I added Bootstrap, Node and Grunt as those were learned.
